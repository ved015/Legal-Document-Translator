# LegalAI - Briding legal gaps for 600M+ Hindi speakers

LegalAI is an AI-driven software tool designed to transform the way legal documents are translated and understood in India. Legal documents in India are predominantly in English, which presents a formidable challenge in legal understanding and literacy for the vast majority of the population. Recognizing that over 90% of the Indian population speaks languages other than English, with a majority of 340M+ being native Hindi speakers.To solve this, I built an AI solution that translates English 'legalese' into Hindi within seconds! I use Cohere's state-of-the-art multilingual AI model Aya to achieve this.

## Features

- PDF text extraction and rendering with Hindi support.
- Translation to Hindi using Cohere's `c4ai-aya` model.
- Streamlit web interface for easy interaction.
